Born in Zigong, Sichuan Province, Learnt Japanese by online courses after get JLPT N3, Started my Internet life from 2003. This page is designed for personal resume.

I speak Mandarin, English and a little Japanese with continous learning. Something could prove my current level in using English is an expired IELTS overall score at 6.5. And I thought daily English conversation is not a problem for me.
